Objective 
The idea is to implement an application which helps the user to organize their workload and activities by associating custom notifications to different working places.
The system tracks the user location with GPS and sends notifications based on their positions and the tasks nearby.
The app will therefore let the user add tasks to the list with a specified location where the task should be done.
For example, if the user wants to go to the copy shop and the supermarket, the app recognizes the proximity to either of the shops.
With this information, it notifies the user when they are close to the location where they have tasks that need to be done.

Context-aware functionalities
•	User position
•	User identity
•	Date, time of day
•	Calendar
•	Orientation (possibly)
•	Temperature (possibly)

Features
•	Login system for different users (User Identity)
•	Map view that shows the tasks of the current user and the user position (GPS)
•	Add task: new tasks can be added with associated description
•	Complete task: completed tasks will be erased from the map
•	Proximity feature: notify the user when they are close to a task location
•	Social media connection (possibly)
•	Expired tasks: if a task is expired or close to expiring, the task will be removed from the list (possibly)
•	Temperature: if it is too hot or too cold to perform a task, it might not be displayed (possibly)

Implementation
	The team will try to implement all the main features (the ones that don’t end with the “possibly” label).

Future work
Possible extensions to the project are all the features marked with the “possibly” label.
Furthermore, a possible improvement to the project would be a responsive UI that uses the accelerometer sensor.
