Our Android project aims at giving the user an overview of which tasks they have to perform in the future and helps 
completing them. 
This focuses on the tasks that have to be done in different places. 
The app will therefore let the user add tasks to the list with a specified location where the task should be done. 
For example, if the user wants to go to the copy shop and the supermarket, the app recognises the proximity to either
of the shops. With this information, it notifies the user when they are close to the location where they have tasks that 
have to be done. The user then can manually set the task as completed.

The goal is to let users wanting to keep track of their tasks do so by providing a clear overview using the map. 
At all times, tasks are displayed on the map with a circle around the task.

The context aware features of the app are the usage of GPS combined with a login system. 
The login system will help to distinguish between different users and their tasks.
